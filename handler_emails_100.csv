34188, Thanks all In a discussion with Steve Kirk prior to changing the priorities it was agreed that SBA shippers should have priority over Interruptible and Alternate shippers only Firm shippers would continue to have priority over SBA shippers Since Gerrys group implemented the changes we have not been in a situation where a SBA was called to come in or go out at an allocated point Gerrys system requirements as to how the system would operate under these conditions would be the support you need to verify that Firm shippers have priority over SBAs Gerry would you forward Michelle a copy of the System Requirement Thanks Reyna Cabrera X33072 Michele Im not sure the information is readily available if available at all TMS data is only maintained without extraordinary measures for 6 months It is my recollection that there may have been an allocation at a point where SBA gas was scheduled and when that occurred the standard allocation procedures were enforced I think once we asked the shipper to move the SBA activity to another point but that was pre GISB Unfortunately because of the how the SBAs work the pack draft and peak points are negotiated in advance which limits the points to use Also the 28 Reyna may have some additional insight in more recent SBA activities I am not sure I understand the question Do you mean at anytime we call on SBA volumes we nevershould not allocate the location I guess the question is Yes you are correct The changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority of SBA contracts will not impact NNGs primary firm shippers What do you need to verify and support this fact Contract Shippers Contract Date 107018 Tenaska Marketing Ventures Nov 1 2000 107019 Texaco Gas Marketing Nov 1 2000 107021 OGE Energy Resources Nov 1 2000 107989 Tenaska Marketing Jun 1 2001 108021 Arkla Energy Marketing Co Jul 1 2001 108284 Tensaka Marketing Ventures Nov 1 2001 108290 Texaco Gas Marketing Nov 1 2001 108281 El Paso Merchant Energy Nov 1 2001 108282 UtiliCorp United Inc Nov 1 2001 108283 Engage Energy American Nov 1 2001 These are the SBA contracts that were provided during the due diligence Id like to be able to verify and support that the changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority for these SBA contracts do not result in an impact to NNGs primary firm shippers Your assistance would be greatly appreciated Thanks MW

73468,The JoskowKahn paper raises two issues price above cost and witholding Enron obviously has concerns with the price above cost analysis I drafted some specific concerns and put them into a draft to Enrons reponse to Hoeker Question 1 Although the detail was dropped in the final draft the basic technical concerns were laid out there To really rebut JoskowKahn would take considerable work Jeff Ds idea was to write a paper that raised issues and indicated how complicated a correct response would be The JoskowKahn withholding section has recieved criticism from the ISO so I am not sure Enron needs to respond to that I think my bottom line now is that the debate at FERC will soon be over or enter a new stage on the 13th As far as how a response would help us in California I think requires a discussion with Jeff Alan MaraNAEnronENRON Mary HainHOUECTECT Alan Before we bring in Seabron Adamson to do some analysis Id like your read of the Joskow and Hogan papers When we have our

NovoselCorpEnronENRON Mary HainHOUECTECT Karen DenneCorpEnronENRON  Susan J MaraNAEnronENRON Alan ComnesPDXECTECT FYI In bizarre times help can sometimes come from bizarre places Granted were likely to disagree strongly with Hogans continued obsession with Poolco but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be helpfulthe Hogan piece Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the JoskowKahn analysis remember its Ed Kahn not Alfred Kahn Seems that it would be very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power included in the paper done by Hogan  Co If in the end there aint nothing useful so be it But seems like theres little downside to exploring it Jim my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper Might want to include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull Seabron Adamson into the thinking too Ultimately may be preferable to have any assessment of Joskow andor Hogan to come from economists rather than directly from us Best Jeff Daniel Douglass 11302000 1129 AM             Has FERC Gone Far Enough in California The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission isnt going far enough in its attempt to reform the California wholesale electric market according to a paper by three prominent economists done for San Diego Gas and Electric The paper by John D Chandley Scott M Harvey and William W Hogan argues that FERC should first end the artificial separation that divides the California Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator rather than worrying about the governance of the two institutions The change in governance may help says the paper Reform in California term Explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be accomplished within an acceptable time frame Hogan of the Kennedy School of Government has been writing since 1995 in opposition to Californias market separation Also argues the paper freeing the California utilities to engage in forward contracting is no panacea The expectation that merely allowing utilities to participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high prices is problematic and not supported by the commissions staff report says the analysis adding that putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts in the present environment may make things worse If the underlying problem in California is high cost and low capacity requiring forward contracting could harm not only California but also the entire Western US electric system FERCs 150 soscratching their heads It does not appear in the staff report and there is little critical analysis of their implications other than the discussion of Commissioner Curt Hebert If the intent of the soft cap is to move toward cost justification for bids above 150MWh then FERC is headed into an administrative morass that would rival those under wellhead price controls in the natural gas industry If on the other hand the soft cap is truly soft and would only require some paper work at FERC and the possibility of a refund if the price is eventually deemed not just and reasonable there might be little impact on consumer prices particularly if the principal sources of those high prices are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of market power Even so the proposal might serve to deter entry and new investments thus combining the worst of both worlds high consumer prices and little or no new investment FERCs proposed order in California also demonstrates confusion about just what constitutes market power The paper cites the proposed orders lawyerly obfuscatory conclusion that while this record does not support findings of specific exercises of market power and while we are not able to reach definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers there is clear evidence that in California market structure and rules provide the opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the Federal Power Act The economists note In this regard the debate is confused because we are dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face In the case of California say the economists there is no evidence of market power Even the practice of generators avoiding the dayof the realincentives including price caps but does not demonstrate the exercise of market power Nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of market power they add The distinction between direct marginal cost and opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion Hence a competitive bidder whose direct cost of generation is 40 but who could sell the same energy outside California for 100 should bid no less than 100 This would not be an exercise of market power

79889,Problem is that core has enough through utility retained gen and QF contracts and noncore is going to market so they dont need any of it which means its both above market and not needed Phillip K AllenENRONenronXgate 06202001 1009 AM Contracts jeff Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE or just above market If the energy is needed by CORE wouldnt the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered Phillip  Kaufman Paul Mara Susan Allen Phillip K Yoder Christian Hall Steve C ContractsSensitivity Confidential PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL As folks are aware we have been engaged in closedpast two weeks regarding a possible marketelectricity crisis In the room are the major large customer groups environmentalists small customers TURN Independent Energy Producers labor the Western States Petroleum Association and Enron The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly Bob Hertzberg When Hertzberg convened the meeting he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a corenoncore structure similar to the structure in place in Californias gas market ie large customers are required to buy gas from the market with Direct Access available to all other customers In effect core customers rez and small business would be served by the utilities retained generating assets and QF contracts and large customers would go to market The corenoncore structure would begin 1103 The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks but is close devising a framework for corenoncore in Californis but who pays for the utilities past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious Unfortunately with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday it is now clear that achieving a corenoncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts The problem is that if core is served by utility gen and QFs and large customers are in the market there is no or very little need for the DWR contracts Instead they look like a signficant stranded cost Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address the DWR contract problem in order to prevent the contracts from 1 killing the corenoncore deal and 2 forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headedinclude Direct Access Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any out clauses that the buyer andor the seller might have under the contract provisions My cursory review of the contracts suggests that outs for the state are minimal or nonexistent In addition weve started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts All this said want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyones contract rights Wed like to have a quick call tomorrow 30options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the corenoncore solution alive Wed like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT Please let me know if this works for you and if it doesnt please let me know if theres a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you Thanks Jeff 
86160,Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The newsletter for the true Texas Longhorn faithful Volume 11 No 16 April 23 2001 True Orange Crystal Ball Shows 2001 Season Will Be Longhorns Break My crystal ball was a little faulty last year because it didnt show TE Bo Scaife going down for the season in the first preWithout that important piece of data I predicted the Longhorns would win at least 10 regular season games They won nine without Scaife and I think they would have won 10 with him because the Stanford loss came before the great freshmen wide receivers became the goIm more confident this year because the Longhorns are deeper and even more talented than they were last season so Im going to go way out on a limb and predict the 2001 season will be remembered as the one we all will recall as the Horns breakBy that I mean I think they will break into the top 10 and stay there for years and years Since the Longhorns havent finished in the top 10 since 1982 that sounds like a tall order for this team This will be coach Mack Browns fourth team at Texas and it should be his best one by far His fourth recruiting class will enroll in September and it will be his third straight great one that means the first group of great recruits will be starting their third years They will be juniors or redshirt sophomores The third year normally is one when players who have been able to play at a high level at times learn how to play at a high level consistently This team will have some flaws but every team has flaws The great teams simply have enough great players to win in spite of their flaws The Longhorns have offensive weapons that are almost off the chart With a healthy Scaife who is that rarity at TE can turn a sixsophomoresfreshman receiving record last year When a team has an awesome tight end and Scaife is one of those with sophomore Brock Edwards not too far behind it creates matchr any defense Linebackers normally cover tight ends and good tight ends even one who arent really fast usually win those matchups Fast tight ends who can catch in a crowd usually draw coverage from a safety But then Williams and Johnson create problems because Williams almost always draws double coverage and Johnson is a huge threat to go all the way if one safety is worrying about Scaife and the other one is helping out on Williams QB Chris Simms seems to be developing into the great player he was expected to be after all the recruiting services tabbed him as the No 1 prospect in the country when he was a senior in high school The obvious solution for a defensive coordinator would be to play five or six defensive backs most of the time or to go to a zone defense But Brown says the Horns will be a better running team than they have been since Ricky Williams departed and a more experienced line and a bigger tailback should make that happen Hodges Mitchell was a great little tailback but this offense is designed primarily to pass or run between the tackles When you want to run between the tackles it helps to have a big powerful tailback The tailback this season whether it is one of the returnees or heralded recruit Cedric Benson will be bigger and more powerful than Mitchell The line was a good passguys back it should be much better this year The only big question about the offense will be one of consistency When Simms who shared time with Major Applewhite last season was at the helm the team often had long long dry spells In the 43is the Longhorns fourBut I remember being scared silly at the half because the offense had made only one first down in the entire half and the defense was showing signs of tiring because of all those 3And that was not an unusual happening In the bowl loss to Oregon Simms took the Longhorns on long backt the Horns generated little offense in the first and third quarters I could cite other examples because there are plenty to cite but Simms is a year older and wiser and so are the receivers who performed better last season than any of us have a right to expect true freshmen to perform A bigger stronger tailback also will be able to pick up more of those thirdDefensively eight starters return from an outstanding unit The Longhorns lost two great defensive tackles but the power teams in the Southern Division of the Big 12 rely a lot more on the pass than they do on the run and the tackles UT will play this year are quicker and might supply a better pass rush Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also made several position changes in the spring that are certain to generate a better pass rush If you remember the Oregon game the Ducks used quick undersized linemen to harass Simms and it worked remarkably well most of the time With former DE Maurice Gordon now a super quick DT and former OLB O J McClintock now a super quick DE look for the Longhorns to be a much better pass rushing team in 2001 I do worry a lot about the Horns placeng in several walkzone and make most of the 40Even if the kicking problems arent solved this is a team with enough weapons offensively and defensively to be a top 10 team No one in the college ranks will be better or deeper at the receiving positions particularly when the tight ends are added to the mix and few teams will have better defensive secondaries The offensive line will be one of the best pass2 and the defensive line despite having two new tackles also will be one of the leagues best Heres the way I see the Big 12 South race winding up and briefly why I place each team at its particular spot 1 Texas 2 Oklahoma another great QB 3 Texas Tech and Oklahoma 4 Texas AM talent 5 Oklahoma State any better 6 Baylor and overworked defense Nebraska should win the North mainly because the Huskers host the big game with Kansas State The Southern Division teams have beaten the North three times in the five championship games and I think Texas or Oklahoma will make it four this year The South is a lot stronger than the folks ts in the North think and its getting stronger every year 900 Number Updated Frequently I update my 900 number at least twice a week with football and football recruiting news The number is 1must be 18 or older to call UT Starts Another Great Recruiting Year with First Pledge The Longhorns have three great recruiting classes in succession and they made a good start on a fourth earlier this month when outstanding Brownwood junior OL Bret Valdez 6coaches Valdez one of the states great run blockers said he went to the UT spring game March 31 and really liked what he saw He said the Texas coaches offered him a scholarship at the spring game They told me I was the first offensive lineman they have offered this year he said adding that he went home and talked to his parents about it and decided he wanted to be a Longhorn He said he came to Austin the weekend after the spring game and competed in the Texas Relays throwing the shot and discus  After I was through competing he said I went over to the coaches offices and talked to coach Mack Brown and coaches Tim Nunez and Mike Tolleson and told them I was ready to commit Im really excited about being a Longhorn He said he also was being recruited by about 20 other schools including Florida State Texas AM Oklahoma Alabama and Notre Dame The first time they can come see us is in May and Florida State AM OU Notre Dame and Alabama coaches had all told my coach they were going to come down and see me then But he said they need to change their travel plans because he is firmly committed to the Longhorns and will tell any other coaches who contact him that he is a future Longhorn Texas has really been recruiting well every year and I think they have a great shot at winning a national championship in the next year or two he said I like the way they emphasize academics too I think Ill have a good chance to start after a redshirt year he said The Longhorns probably will sign only three offensive line prospects next February and the coaches have not offered scholarships to any other offensive line prospects I have been talking to so they must consider Valdez to be the states top OL prospect Brownwood went 11s thrown the shot 53 feet and discus 162On tape Valdez is a very aggressive blocker who has an explosive start that allows him to make quick contact and then he simply drives his guy backward He has the quickest start of any of the big offensive line prospects I have seen this year One of the best things about him is that he is only 16 and wont turn 17 until June 15 but he already benches 320 and squats 600 The Longhorns need a bumper crop of defensive linemen this year and they stand a very good chance to get an early commitment from one of the top ones around at their early June camp He is Lyle Sendlein 6s the No 1 recruit in Arizona Sendlein is the son of former UT and NFL LB Robin Sendlein and he is the brother of UT redshirt freshman LB Austin Sendlein I talked to Sendlein Sunday and he told me he is coming to the June 4 Longhorn camp I asked him if he is planning on going to any other camps this summer It depends on what happens at the Texas camp he said I might commit I really like Texas He said he also is being recruited by Notre Dame Arizona UCLA Arizona State USC and about 15 other schools Another top DT prospect who is a strong Texas lean is Kasey Studdard 6260 48 of Highlands Ranch Colo He is the son of David Studdard a former UT offensive line star who started for the Denver Broncos for about 10 years after his career at Texas Studdard told me Sunday he probably isnt going to go to any summer camps but he said I really like Texas He said other schools recruiting him include Colorado Colorado State Nebraska Washington USC and Missouri His sister Katie recently accepted a basketball scholarship at Northern Colorado DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster who has thrown the shot nearly 61 feet says he is bigger and also a little bit faster than I have him listed Im 6who carries a 36 GPA on a 40 scale and has already made a qualifying score on the SAT I want to take it again to try to do better but Ive already made a qualifying score he said When I asked him if he plans to go to any camps this summer Dibbles said Im going to the Nike camp at AM and a Texas camp probably in late June I might go to one more camp maybe at Oklahoma He said Oklahoma LSU TCU and SMU have already offered him a scholarship and said other schools recruiting him include UT Notre Dame AM Purdue Florida and Nebraska When asked what he is looking for in a school he said Academics has to be first I want to major in something in the engineering or computer range I also want to know about the graduation rate for football players The coaches are important too and the chance to get playing time He said he went to the Longhorn coaches offices after competing in the Texas Relays and met with head coach Mack Brown DE coach Hardee McCrary and RB coach Bruce Chambers who recruits the Lancaster area It was nice in Austin he said Im pretty interested in Texas He also said he thinks Lancaster has a chance to make a good run in the playoffs this year We got to the third round last year and lost to Ennis he said Ennis won state and we had a lot of young players so we think we have a chance to do better this year Some of the top football players in the state are also some of the top track performers UT CB signee Michael Huff won the District 7and anchored the 400Another Longhorn CB recruit Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes won the District 27triple jump with a 42There are always a lot of regional qualifier meets between the district and regional meets and junior RB DaBryan Blanton of Forney had some great times at the one in Glen Rose Friday running a 101 100 meters and 207 200 meters UT WR recruit Quan Cosby of Mart was second in both races running 105 and 2118 Junior RBCB Edorian McCullough of North Garland who is undefeated in the dashes this year ran 1036 and 2089 and anchored his 400to a win in 4107 in a regional qualifer meet in Mansfield Huff was second in the 200 in 2154 and third in the 100 in 1055 UT LB recruit Derrick Johnson ran a 1079 for third place in the 100 in a regional qualifiers meet in McGregor He has run a 106 this year

394558,Dave Ill get with Kevin Mike and Bob for consensus but first my two cents worth is that this doesnt make sense from a purely commercial standpoint It only makes sense if legal believes it is necessary Ive reviewed the proposal and technically have no problems with it Commercially however I have some problems First a few facts 1 The permit currently allows for over 1000 hours per year 2 A reduction to 9 ppm would allow for an increase to approx 3000 hours per year 3 Best case heat rate is 12300 which is the highest heat rate of all the peakers Extra run hours would be more valuable at one of the other TVA plants with a lower HR If New Albany were a good candidate for combined cycle then the extra run hours would be more valuable but as a simple cycle its difficult to envision needing more than 1000 hours 4 Though certainly not a representative year this year we ran approx 225 hours at New Albany 5 In 1999 we ran approximately 450 hours at New Albany With the loss of control area status ie parking privileges I would expect this to increase in a typical year but still not significantly above 1000 hours 6 Any increase in run hours would not be automatic though probable since a permit change would be required 7 This proposal would also clean up some other technical issues flame scanners etc however we have other proposals from PSM to clean these up for approx 100k 8 I leave it up to Kevin and Rogers to value their run hours but my view is that it is of minimal value and certainly not worth the 78MM in the proposal Im not as familiar with the Doyle contract so Ive not analyzed for the 39MM for Doyle Bottom line I recommend going forward only if driven by legal concerns Again Ill get back to you after Ive talked to Kevin Mike and Bob Mitch David W DelaineyECT 09252000 1023 AM MillerHOUECTECT Robert P VirgoHOUECTECT Guys Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and Doyle 7B burners This could possibly have two benefits a elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues they are having with GE and b apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission correlating into increased operating hours I need two things to determine if we want to move forward a Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent or lack thereof issues on the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and b Mitch Kevin Mike and Bob I need your technical and commercial opinions on the merits of this proposal ie do you as a team support this proposal I believe the timing on this is rather short Please get back to me at your earliest convenience I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you Regards Delainey

437549,Read belowp never exactly known for flagope in so many ways including the fight against the evil we face today 18 Americans Blaming America The traumatic events of September 11 provided something of amoral Rorschach Test for Americans The vast majority of ourpeople world as an unmitigated act of evil whatever their views on Americanpolicies at home or abroad But on the political fringes of our country there were some whojust as instinctively reached for explanations in which Americansin the end were at least partly responsible for our own tragicmisfortune In the current issue of The Nation Robert Fisk deplores theterrorist attacks but then all but equates them to a variety of USand Israeli actions the sanctions that have destroyed the livesof perhaps half a million children in Iraq the 17500 civilianskilled in Israels 1982 invasion of Lebanon etc etc No saysFisk you cant blame anyone else for the September 11 attacksbut the malign influence of history and our share in its burdenmust surely stand in the dark with the suicide bombers Thisslippery line of reasoning is of course being echoed on televisioneach night by a variety of Middle East experts who begin bydeploring the terrorists but who eventually get around to blamingAmerica for not forcing Israel to cave into Palestinian demandsthus angering public opinion in Arab and other Islamic countries On the Right there was a breathtaking example of blameAmerica opinion from none other than the Reverends JerryFalwell and Pat Robertson on the latters Christian BroadcastingNetwork Quoth Falwell I really believe that the pagans and theabortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians whoare actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle the ACLUand the People for the American Way tried to secularize America say You helped this happenand allow the enemies of America to give us probably what wedeserve Robertson quickly replied Jerry thats my feeling Perhaps the dozens of conservative politicians and commentatorswho last year vilified Senator John McCain for calling Falwell andRobertson extremists owe the Arizona Senator an apology These sporadic expressions of blame America sentiment havebeen relatively rare But they are eerily congruent with the rhetoricof terrorists aflame at the alleged arrogance or wickedness ofAmerica Those on the Left who demonize our Middle Eastpolicies or our support for economic globalization and those onthe Right who are convinced that our culture is fatally decadentshould prayerfully reflect on this congruence Perhaps then theycan begin to share the moral clarity of most of their fellowAmerica is hardly perfect but in this fight against terrorism itsthe best hope for good in the face of evil Further Reading Terror in America by Robert Fisk The Nation October 1 2001  SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION You are subscribed to ndolorg  ppionlineorgemail newsletters as  To subscribe unsubscribe or change yoursubscription preferences go  The New Dem Daily is published every weekdaymorning by the Democratic Leadership Council Complete archives are available on NDOLorg
